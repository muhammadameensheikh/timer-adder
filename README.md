# Time Adder

ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @muhammadameensheikh

I created a time adder function. This function which takes 4 arguments, 2 values and 2 labels and returns the sum of the 2 values added in seconds, minutes, hours or days. 

I have added a validation to check that the correct labels are added and the numbers is a positive integer
